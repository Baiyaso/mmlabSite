title: ðŸ“Š Electric motor and motion control
linkTitle: EE275 2023
summary: The course is arranged in a manner of "from theory to engineering". This is one essential core course to cover the four major courses, including electric machinery (steady state behaviors, winding design), ac machine transient analysis (mathematical modeling, numerical simulation), machine design (winding function, multi-phase machine theory, maxwell stress tensor), and motor control with an emphasis on engineering practices (controller tuning, inverter modeling). Lecture notes will be distributed online when ready.

## Program overview

The course is arranged in a manner of "from theory to engineering". This is one essential core course to cover the four major courses, including electric machinery (steady state behaviors, winding design), ac machine transient analysis (mathematical modeling, numerical simulation), machine design (winding function, multi-phase machine theory, maxwell stress tensor), and motor control with an emphasis on engineering practices (controller tuning, inverter modeling). 

Students are gonna get their hands dirty learning Python programming and numerical simulation skills along the way.

Lecture notes will be distributed online when ready.
